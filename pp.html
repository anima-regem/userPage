  <p>In order to comply with any applicable regulatory requirement or for additional services/products via the App/Website, as and when offered, we may need you to provide additional details. We may also use data lawfully obtained from third-party service providers authorized by you.</p>

  <h2>Express Consent</h2>

  <p>You expressly consent to C&C (including its marketing channels and business partners) contacting you via SMS, call, and/or email and following up with regard to the services provided through the App/Website, for imparting product knowledge, offering promotional offers running on the App/Website, and various other offers/services by our partners when you submit your details/documents via the App/Website, including but not limited to the personal information as mentioned herein.</p>

  <h2>Automatically Gathered Data while Utilizing the App or Website</h2>

  <p>By requesting no permissions from the App / Website until absolutely necessary to enable the functioning of the App / Website, we work to limit automatically recorded information to a minimum. However, we may gather data about how you use our app or website, including your IP address, browser type, mobile operating system, mobile device manufacturer and model, access time, and time spent. We may also keep track of the screens and pages you visit when using our app or website, as well as other actions you perform.</p>

  <p>However, unless required by applicable legislation, we won't disclose any personally identifiable information with these third parties if we use their services for automatic data collecting.</p>

  <h2>Utilization of Personal Data</h2>

  <p>The Information cannot be duplicated or reproduced in any way other than as stated in this agreement, and we will not transmit, sell, or rent it to anyone else. Your information is the only property you have submitted to C&C. We might use the data gathered to provide some of our goods and services.</p>

  <p>We do not, however, divulge any information to third parties in order to promote their goods and services. We can gather statistics about your usage from information that is automatically collected as you use the App or Website, which enables us to give you a better-tailored and efficient experience.</p>

  <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>

  <p>Aside from disclosures that are requested or mandated by law, a court, a governmental agency, or an authority, we never disclose any of your personal information to a third party unless it is necessary for identity verification, for the prevention, detection, and investigation of crimes, including cybercrimes, or for the prosecution and punishment of offenders.</p>

  <p>With our partners who provide services for us (such as document collecting, card distribution, collection agencies, and other connected partners, etc.) and assist us in running our business, we might need to share limited personal information with them. Your personal information will only be used by our partners in accordance with the instructions we provide.</p>

  <h2>Information Security</h2>

  <p>To safeguard against unauthorized access, we implement the necessary security measures. To prevent unauthorized access to the systems where we hold personal data, these internal assessments of our data collecting, storage, and processing procedures and security safeguards include suitable encryption and physical security measures. All data collected through our app and website is safely kept in a restricted database. The servers' access is carefully monitored, password-protected, and limited.</p>

  <h2>Privacy of your Account</h2>

  <p>Your account's security is your sole responsibility, and you are not permitted to give anybody else the login information that was given to you for the App or website. In the event that someone else uses your login information without your permission or in violation of this Privacy Policy, we will not be held liable or responsible.</p>

  <h2>Retaining your Data</h2>

  <p>If you ask us to terminate your account with us, we will keep your information for as long as that is required to offer you the services offered on the App or Website, whichever comes first. After your account is closed, we may keep using your anonymized data in aggregate or in conjunction with the anonymized data of other users.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of data analysis, profiling, and research, we use this aggregated, anonymized data. In order to avoid fraud, exercise or defend a legal claim, or if necessary, provide evidence in legal proceeding(s), we may preserve your contact information along with your application details (if any).</p>
